If you're taking aspirin to lower a fever, the recommended dosage for adults is one to two tablets every three to four hours, up to six times per day. For reducing the risk of stroke, the recommended dosage is one tablet four times a day or two tablets twice a day. It's important to note that even doses given throughout the day can be as effective, or more effective, than several doses throughout the day.
